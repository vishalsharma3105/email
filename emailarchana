Hi Shruti,
As you are already aware that I am currently on sabbatical till March 31, 2020 after my maternity leaves.
I also saw an email from Rahul about non billing staff to opt for sabbatical. So I would like to extend my sabbatical till October 2020. 
I am taking above decision owning to below reasons:
  1.	As per RD’s email some of the projects in the company are getting ramp down, assuming  I will not be a billing resource as soon as I join.
  2.	Day care facilities experience I opted in my first attempt came really bad, and it impacted my baby’s health.
  3.	Owning to the gap due to lockdown I will have to start over with familiarizing my baby with new day care.
  4.	Due to coronavirus scare, all day care options are not available and believing that this will end by June 2020 completely I will need at least 2-3 months to get baby familiarize to new day care.
Please accept apologies from my end, for extending dates again, but please be assured that I am not doing it on purpose, and I have some serious obligations relating to baby.
Thank you in anticipation.
Thanks
Archana Bhardwaj
