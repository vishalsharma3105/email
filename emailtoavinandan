Hi Avinandan,

As we discussed on phone, this is regarding the corporate policy A2833326A issued to Archana Bhardwaj.

There was a cashless maternity claim on 19th Feb, 2019, and full eligible amount was disbursed for the same by Chola Manadalam.

As hospital bill was higher than the maximum eligible amount, my husband has claimed rest of the amount form his insurer. 

The other insurer needs all the documents signed and stamped from first insurer. Could you please help me in this regard and provide me the same as without this we may face a loss of money.

Thanks and Regards
Archana Bhardwaj
