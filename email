Dear Team,

This is regarding the query raised against claim number H0204191224882B002-(98158803):

As per your email, following documents are missing; please find my response in bold below:

•	all the documents sign and stamp from other insurance
Since this was a cashless claim form my Wife’s insurance provided by her employer, it is getting difficult to get this. My wife is still recovering from c section operation and it will be not right for to travel office during maternity leaves for document. Please consider. Moreover all the documents are with med buddy now, so not sure how this will work.  
•	settlement letter with sign and stamp from other insurance from which get settled.
I have now received the Settlement letter from the employer of my wife. As insurance is not ready toprovideus anything thing directly. It is attached herewith.
•	Pre numbered cash receipt for the amount collected from the patient on 22/02/2019 for Rs. 5772-original pre no reciept against the bill of babay

This receipt was missed somehow, so I went to the hospital and got the receipt re-generated. As per discussion on email, these receipts have duplicate marked, but if you check them they have original stamp and sign form hospital. So please consider them as original. Also all the bills provided are bill cum receipts so they can be considered as original receipts.
•	Pre numbered cash receipt for the amount collected from the patient on 29/12/18 for Rs. 5000-Original pre no reciept against the bill of mother :
